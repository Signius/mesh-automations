        "rationale": "We see the proposed roadmap  for 2025 as a helpful effort in building ecosystem wide alignment on top priorities, and vote Yes on this proposal. We also hope that this proposal will encourage other efforts which aim to propose further roadmaps for the Cardano ecosystem. Since we achieved the last of the initial Cardano Milestones with Voltaire, we think that longterm roadmaps at Cardano have proven their worth and value and are a existential part of our culture and careful longterm thinking"

Having a smaller NCL sends a clear message to the ecosystem to be careful and more strict in our budget allocations in 2025.\n\nAlso worth to keep in mind that in 2025, we are in the periodically recurring bull year, from historical data we can expect a increase of Ada price, meaning that less Ada have to be spend. This is already the case since we see many budget proposals currently calculating their budget requests on 0.50 USD per Ada, yet the last time Ada was globally traded at 0.50 USD/Ada was in late 2024.\n\nTherefore, we support the NCL = 200M ADA."

Good enough to agree with. Lets then make sure that we effectively allocate budgets up to 350m ADA in 2025 and not waste funds with projects no one needs. "
