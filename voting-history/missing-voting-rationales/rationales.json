Having a smaller NCL sends a clear message to the ecosystem to be careful and more strict in our budget allocations in 2025.\n\nAlso worth to keep in mind that in 2025, we are in the periodically recurring bull year, from historical data we can expect a increase of Ada price, meaning that less Ada have to be spend. This is already the case since we see many budget proposals currently calculating their budget requests on 0.50 USD per Ada, yet the last time Ada was globally traded at 0.50 USD/Ada was in late 2024.\n\nTherefore, we support the NCL = 200M ADA."

Furthermore, we do have doubts of the need of a funding administrator as outlined in the proposal, which itself consumes already several million Ada. Furthermore, even if we may support a large part of the proposals within the package, we identify several budget allocation within the package as highly concerning and dont feel confident to give it a lumb yes vote. We would prefer a  more granular approach which allows voters to decide onchain on each proposal and not only on the whole package as one.\n\nfeasible deliverables,\nDue to the massive package, including a wide range of proposals as well as a funding administrator from which we saw in the past that many efforts have not been managed as effectively as we would like to, we see large risks in the successful delivery of the proposal. The produced overhead likely introduces many non-essential burocratic processes which will consume time and resources which could be better spend otherwise and which actually introduces many risks since the process introduces a single point of failure with a central funding administrator on which all proposals have to rely on. The new onchain governance system, in our perspective, was set to exactly avoid such single points of failures. \n\nEcosystem value,\nSummarising all notes already mentioned, we see a high risk in the successful execution of the proposal and therefore have to doubt the value provided to the ecosystem. \n\nTeam,\nMany proposals included in the package have awesome teams with highest skill sets and experience, however, this does not account for all proposals, either does it apply to the funding administrator. Lets be clear, we appreciate Intersect and its effort, yet the past has shown that many efforts at Intersect have not been able to stand up and match with the communities expectations. We surely believe that intersect has its place at the ecosystem, and while Intersect matures and gains experience and expertise, we still think that Intersect at its current stage has a high risk on being a effective administrator of such a large budget and scope. \n\nRecommendation.\nLearn from Project Catalyst, start small, build experience and expertise step by step and increase scope and budgets over time to ensure that the actual capacities to effectively manage such large operations are battle proofed and well matured.\n\nIf you approve of our reasoning and want to further support us, we welcome you to delegate to our Mesh DRep\nMore about our DRep at: https://gov.meshjs.dev/drep-voting"
