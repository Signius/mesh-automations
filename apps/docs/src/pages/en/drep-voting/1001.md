# MeshJS DRep Voting History

As a Delegated Representative (DRep) in the Cardano ecosystem, MeshJS takes its governance responsibilities seriously. This section documents our voting history and the rationale behind each decision we make.

## Our Voting Philosophy

- **Transparency**: We maintain a clear record of all our votes and the reasoning behind them
- **Community-Focused**: Our decisions prioritize the long-term health and growth of the Cardano ecosystem
- **Technical Excellence**: We evaluate technical proposals based on their merit and potential impact
- **Sustainable Growth**: We support initiatives that promote sustainable development of the ecosystem

## Structure of Voting Records

Each vote is documented with the following information:
- **Proposal Title & Hash**: Unique identifiers for each governance action
- **Action ID**: The specific governance action identifier
- **Type**: The category of the governance action
- **Epochs**: Proposal and expiration epochs
- **Vote**: Our decision (Yes ✅, No ❌, or Abstain ⚪)
- **Vote Submission Date**: Date the vote was cast
- **Rationale**: Detailed explanation of our voting decision
